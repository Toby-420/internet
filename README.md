If Windows Connectivity Troubleshooter is being incredibly slow and you just want it to reset your adaptors (for bad wifi cards and such), just use this batch file and it will do it much faster. Usually takes a few seconds

The part at the start (above the dashes) allows you to get the admin permissions, so feel free to use that
